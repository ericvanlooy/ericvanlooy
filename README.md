- 👋 Hi, I’m @ericvanlooy
- 👀 I’m a novice but intrigued by the world of coding (mainly front-end)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through TOP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that peaks my interest. I'm a linguist at heart, so loc-related products could be my thing
- 📫 Reach me on Discord (looneyvicar)
